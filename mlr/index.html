                Welcome to the MLR Career Stats page! 
                <br />
				<br />
				Updated for Season 6! I think everything should work okay but who knows. MiLR stuff hasn't started yet so those pages are likely gonna be broken until the season starts. 
				<br />
				<br />
				MLN stats may not happen because I don't want to actively maintain this page really, and that would require finding all the connected accounts/name changes there/etc and it seems difficult to do automatically. :( Maybe I can add some quality of life updates like changing "4" to "4.000" when applicable, etc.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you notice anything wrong please ping me: pull#0053. Thanks.

				I fixed the website. Google sux. CORS sux. It might break again in the future. Who knows. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Also I made names automatically update. Yay. Name-changers rejoice. MLN stats potentially coming soon? Idk. Gonna be pretty busy soon I'd imagine...

				Today I made it so that all pages now automatically update with Season 5 data. Okay, this is epic. 
				<br />
				<br />
				If you notice anything wrong please ping me: pull#0053
				<br />
				<br />
				Next step is probably to add in MLN stuff to this. Maybe not. I'll see what I can do. Enjoy!

                Welcome to the MLR Career Stats page! 
                <br />
				<br />
				Today I have added in MiLR data from season 3 onwards. You can now find your MiLR stats on the Player Stats page as well as both hitting and pitching custom MiLR leaderboards.
				<br />
				<br />
				I also think I fixed the "incorrect leaderboard" issue. Now, there should be a warning when this issue occurs, but I fixed the known causes of this issue. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Additionally, I fixed an issue where five S1 players had an additional game played.
				<br />
				<br />
				There are still known issues. For some reason, I can't get the expando menu to pull down when I'm on mobile, so I'll post the links to all the pages right here in case this happens to you:
				<ul>
				<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
				<li><a href="stats.html">Player Stats</a></li>
				<li><a href="h_leaderboards.html">Hitting Leaderboards</a></li>
				<li><a href="p_leaderboards.html">Pitching Leaderboards</a></li>
				<li><a href="h_leaderboards_milr.html">MiLR Hitting</a></li>
				<li><a href="p_leaderboards_milr.html">MiLR Pitching</a></li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<br />
				MLR stats last updated 7/8/2020. MiLR stats last updated 7/9/2020.

                Welcome to the MLR Career Stats page! 
                <br />
				<br />
                Here you can find career stats for hitters and pitchers in MLR.
                <br />
				<br />
				You can also view customized leaderboards for hitting and pitching. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Some of the stuff will be slightly different from the stats sheet. For some I don't know why. This might be slightly inaccurate. If you find anything blatantly incorrect feel free to ping me: pull#0053
				<br />
				<br />
				By default, certain stats ignore IBBs, Auto BBs, and Auto Ks. If you're viewing the custom leaderboards page, however, you can include these by selecting the options with the suffix _2. For example, OBP ignores IBBs and Auto BBs while OBP_2 includes these. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Also Runs Scored for hitters might be slightly inaccurate due to pinch runners. It's hard to track pinch runners using the PA logs. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Season 1 data in general might be slightly incorrect... I've found many discrepancies with the official stats pages unfortunately.  
				<br />
				<br />
				These also don't automatically update. Last updated: 7/8/2020
